Introduction

This repository is a home for snippets, tips and tricks and examples of scripting for the Jenkins Pipeline plugin.
Layout

The repository is broken up into four directories currently:

    pipeline-examples - for general Pipeline examples.
    global-library-examples - for examples of how to write and use the global library on a Jenkins master.
    jenkinsfile-examples - for examples of using Jenkinsfiles checked into repositories.
    docs - for documentation, guides and other non-code content.

Please put your script into its own directory under the appropriate directory above, with a README.md file included explaining what your script does or shows. Make sure your script is commented so that others can understand how it works, why it works, etc.
